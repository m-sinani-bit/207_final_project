# Project Overview
This project is centered around the development of a machine-learning model capable of predicting brain spectrogram diagnosis. Utilizing a specialized dataset, our goal is to accurately classify harmful brain activity (in our case seizures), which could have profound implications for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.

# Repository Contents:
Initial_EDA.ipynb: Notebook containing our initial exploratory data analysis, providing insights into the dataset's structure

data_prep.ipynb: Preprocessing steps required to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling, baseline model, logistic regression

je-model-add.ipynb: Outlines the additional model augmentations

kamw2 (1).ipynb:  Further attempts to refine the model and increase prediction accuracy.

# Execution Environment
The models and notebooks were run on Kaggle, allowing us to leverage their robust computational resources. This approach is common among students for its efficiency and reproducibility. Kaggle's collaborative environment also facilitated seamless teamwork and code sharing.

# Dataset
The dataset for this project is hosted on Kaggle and consists of brain spectrograms used to classify neurological activity. Due to privacy regulations, the data has been preprocessed to ensure patient anonymity.
